    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your grill to 300Â°F with direct and indirect heat zones . Place an aluminum pan under the grill grate on one side and fill halfway with water. Wearing protective gloves , pour a chimney of hot coals on the other side. Toss a few apple wood chunks on top of the coals. </li>
        <li> Remove the membrane under each slab of ribs by inserting a butter knife between the membrane and one of the bones. Grab the membrane with a paper towel and pull to remove it completely. </li>
        <li> Combine the brown sugar, salt, pepper, paprika, cayenne powder, ginger and thyme in a small bowl. Apply the rub on both sides of the ribs. Press with your hands for the rub to penetrate the meat. </li>
        <li> Place the ribs on the grill grate over indirect heat. Close the lid and cook for 2 hours. </li>
        <li> Combine apple butter, ketchup, brown sugar, vinegar, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, salt and pepper in a saucepan. Simmer for 10 minutes and set aside. </li>
        <li> After 2 hours of cooking, remove ribs from grill. Place each on a separate sheet of aluminum foil. Pour 1 cup of Apple Butter BBQ Sauce on top of each rack and wrap in foil. Place on indirect heat side of the grill and cook for another hour. </li>
        <li> Once your ribs are fully cooked, remove the foil and sear over direct heat for 30 seconds per side to caramelize the BBQ sauce. </li>
        <li>Slice between the bones and serve with some grilled potato salad and smoked corn on the cob . </li>
