    <h2>About the Recipe</h2>
    <p>Filet mignon is the smaller tip of tenderloin and one of the most expensive cuts of steak, due to its prized texture and that’s only about 2% of the total animal. Fun fact: When filet mignon isn’t riding solo on your plate, it can also be a part of another cut, the T-bone. The T-bone consists of strip steak on the bigger side of the bone, and filet mignon on the shorter side. If you can’t decide what you like, opt for a T-bone and you can have both.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4 (6-oz.) filet mignon</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon roughly chopped rosemary</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>3-4 Apple wood chunks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Season steak with salt and pepper on both sides. When oil is just about to smoke, add steak. Cook until very seared, about 5 minutes, then flip and add butter and rosemary. Baste with butter and cook another 3 to 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Transfer skillet to oven and cook until cooked to your liking, about 5 minutes for medium. Pro tip: Check the temperature of your meat before transferring to the oven to see how far you are from the desired temperature. If you are within 10 degrees, you may need even less time. If your steak isn't done after 5 minutes, check every couple of minutes so you don't risk over cooking. </li>
        <li>Remove from pan and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
