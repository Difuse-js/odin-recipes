    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rolled Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Parchment paper cut into a 14 inch circle</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>8 Thin slices provolone cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>6 slices Genoa salami, halved or quartered</li>
        <li>8 ounces fresh shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>16-18 Pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Grated pecorino romano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Place pizza stone on the grate when it’s cool. Then preheat one side of your grill to 450°F, leaving the other side off for indirect heat. </li>
        <li> Place onion and bell pepper slices in an oven-safe pan. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Season with salt and Italian seasoning. Toss to coat evenly. Place pan on the grill. Close the lid and roast for 20 minutes. Stir at the half-way point and remove from grill when done. </li>
        <li>  Increase your grill heat to 550°F. </li>
        <li> Roll out the dough on a 14” piece of parchment paper. “Dock” your pizza dough by poking it with a fork or docking tool to allow steam to escape when cooking. Brush the edges with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Cover the dough with provolone cheese, leaving about ½ inch from the edge uncovered. </li>
        <li>  Pour pizza sauce on top of the cheese and spread evenly. </li>
        <li>  Add salami and half of the veggies. Top with mozzarella cheese. Add pepperoni and the rest of the veggies. </li>
        <li> Holding the edge of the parchment paper, slide your pizza peel under the paper. Open the grill and carefully slide the paper and pizza onto the stone. Close the grill and cook for 5 minutes. Then rotate the pizza about 180 degrees. Cook until the crust is crisp, and the cheese starts to turn golden brown, about another 4 to 6 minutes. </li>
        <li> CAREFULLY slide the peel under the parchment paper and remove the pizza. Set it on a resting rack for about 3 minutes until the pizza cools. </li>
        <li> Move to a cutting board and top with parsley, red pepper flakes and grated Pecorino Romano cheese.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve. </li>
    </ol>
